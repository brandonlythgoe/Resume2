## Service and Work History

`September, 2022 - Present`
__Data Entry Clerk, HireMySub__

Currently I input contracting companies into a website called HireMySub.com. I absoultlely love my job and enjoy researching the top contracting companies across the United States. This has helped me develop an attention to detail, and helped me become more comfortable working on my laptop for extended periods of time.

`January,2022 - July 2022`
__Employee, BenchMark Potato Factory__

I Sorted Potatoes, Stacked boxes, and made some awesome friends during my time at Benchmark. This opprotunity helped me learn to work hard and to be a team player no matter what.

`2019-2021`
__Missionary__, Austin TX

For 2 years I had the priviledge of serving the people in the Austin and San Antonio area. I learned so much from my time as a missionary that have shaped me into the person I am today. I learned the joy that comes from serving others, and the positive impact that I can have on others. I found that I could learn valuable lessons from anyone and everyone that I came in contact with. I also learned more about who I am, and the impact I can have on those around me.

`June 2019-August 2019`
__Salesman, Skytech Solutions__

The Summer after I graduated High School, I sold Dish And DirectTV door to door for Skytech solutions. I really enjoyed me time as a salesman, I learned to have thick skin, and built self-confidence. I really enjoyed getting to know different types of people and relate with them, and feel that my experience as a salesman helped prepare me for my missionary service.

`2017-2019`
__Employee, Greenfield Lakes Golf Course__

While I was in High School, I had an amazing job working at Greenfield Lakes Golf Course. It was the perfect high school job for me. I was primarly responsible for washing and prepping the golf carts, picking up the range balls, and pulling the pins at the end of the night. My time at Greenfield taught me how to interact with other employees and supervisors and develop a love for work.
